# Coral Sr/Ca calibration - An example from Dry Tortugas


Calibration is a commonly perfomed task in paleoclimatology to relate measured proxy values to environmental variables of interest. There are several statistical methods available to do this, resulting in a somewhat confusing landscape for first-timers and non-specialists. This website covers the calibration of coral Sr/Ca to sea surface temperature using data from Dry Tortugas (DeLong et al., 2011). The website illustrates the frequentist and Bayesian approaches to the task.

## Structure

This [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) is broken down into three chapters:
- Data exploration of the Sr/Ca data from three cores and nearby sea surface temperature data
- Frequentist calibration using ordinary and weighted least square regression
- Bayesian calibration presents a Bayesian alternative to OLS.
